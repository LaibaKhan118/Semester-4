"""Design a Model-Based Agent that controls classroom lights.
Environment States:
• Students Present: Yes / No
• Light Status: ON / OFF
Agent Model (Memory):
The agent must store:
• Previous student presence
• Previous light status
Rules:
1. If students are present and lights are OFF → Turn lights ON
2. If no students and lights are ON → Turn lights OFF
3. Otherwise → No action
The agent must update and display its internal model after each step.
Student presence should be randomly generated every iteration.
Run for 8 steps.
